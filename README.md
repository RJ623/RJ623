- 👋 Hi, I’m Runjia She, and you can call me Steve.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, but didn't try Python before. I majored in applied business analytics in MET college, so I want to learn more analytics tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently want to find a job as a business analyst or data analyst. 
- 💞️ I took this class as an elective course. My friend recommend me to learn more about Python, which will be helpful in the future.
- 📫 I will graduate at the end of this year, so I want to learn more about finding jobs and interview skills, and I plan to find an internship about data analytics or business analytics this summer.
