- 👋 Hi, I’m Runjia She, and you can call me Steve.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, but didn't use Python before. I majored in applied business analytics, so I want to learn more analytics tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently want to find job as an business analyst or data analyst. 
- 💞️ I took this class as an elective course, and my friend recommend me to learn more not only Rstudio, but also about Python.
- 📫 This is my second semester, and I will graduate at the end of this year. I want to learn more about finding jobs and interview skills, and I plan to find an internship about data analytics or business analytics this summer.
